import Combine

/// `DeferredFutureSingle` is a ready-made Combine Publisher which allows you to
/// dynamically send success or failure events.
///
/// It lets you easily create custom single publishers to wrap most
/// non-publisher asynchronous work.
///
/// You create this publisher by providing a closure. This closure runs when
/// the publisher is subscribed to. It returns a cancellable object in which
/// you define any cleanup actions to execute when the publisher completes,
/// or when the subscription is canceled.
///
///     let publisher = DeferredFutureSingle<String, MyError> { promise in
///         // Eventually send completion event, now or in the future:
///         promise(.success("Alice"))
///         // OR
///         promise(.failure(MyError()))
///
///         return AnyCancellable {
///             // Perform cleanup
///         }
///     }
///
/// `DeferredFutureSingle` can be seen as a "deferred future"
/// single publisher:
///
/// - Nothing happens until the publisher is subscribed to. A new job starts
///   on each subscription.
/// - It can complete right on subscription, or at any time in the future.
///
/// When needed, `DeferredFutureSingle` can forward its job to another
/// single publisher:
///
///     let publisher = DeferredFutureSingle<String, MyError> { promise in
///         return otherSinglePublisher.sinkSingle(receive: promise)
///     }
