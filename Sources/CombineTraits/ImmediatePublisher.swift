/// `ImmediatePublisher` is the protocol for publishers that publish an element
/// or fail right on subscription, synchronously, without any delay.
///
/// In the Combine framework, the built-in `Just` and `Fail` are examples of
/// publishers that conform to `ImmediatePublisher`.
///
/// Conversely, `Publishers.Sequence` is not an immediate publisher, because not
/// all sequences contain at least one element. `URLSession.DataTaskPublisher`
/// is not an immediate publisher, because it is asynchronous.
///
/// # ImmediatePublisher Benefits
///
/// Once you have a publisher that conforms to `ImmediatePublisher`, you have
/// access to two desirable tools:
///
/// - An `AnyImmediatePublisher` type that hides details you don’t want to
///   expose across API boundaries. For example, the user of the publisher below
///   knows that it publishes a first `String` immediately:
///
///         func namePublisher() -> AnyImmediatePublisher<String, Never>
///
///   You build an `AnyImmediatePublisher` with the
///   `eraseToAnyImmediatePublisher()` method:
///
///         myImmediatePublisher.eraseToAnyImmediatePublisher()
///
/// # Building Immediate Publishers
///
/// In order to benefit from the `ImmediatePublisher` protocol, you need a
/// concrete publisher that conforms to this protocol.
///
/// There are a few ways to get such an immediate publisher:
///
/// - **Compiler-checked immediate publishers** are publishers that conform to
///   the `ImmediatePublisher` protocol. This is the case of `Just`, for
///   example. Some publishers conditionally conform to `ImmediatePublisher`,
///   such as `Publishers.Map`, when the upstream publisher is an
///   immediate publisher.
///
///   When you define a publisher type that publishes an element or fails right
///   on subscription, you can turn it into an immediate publisher with
///   an extension:
///
///         struct MyImmediatePublisher: Publisher { ... }
///         extension MyImmediatePublisher: ImmediatePublisher { }
///
/// - **Runtime-checked immediate publishers** are publishers that conform to
///   the `ImmediatePublisher` protocol by checking, at runtime, that an
///   upstream publisher publishes an element or fails right on subscription.
///
///     `Publisher.assertImmediate()` returns an immediate publisher that raises
///     a fatal error if the upstream publisher does not publish an element or
///     fail right on subscription.
///
/// - **Unchecked immediate publishers**: you should only build such an
///   immediate publisher when you are sure that the `ImmediatePublisher`
///   contract is honored by the upstream publisher.
///
///   For example:
///
///         // CORRECT
///         Just(1).uncheckedImmediate()
///
///         // WRONG
///         Empty().uncheckedImmediate()
///         Just(1).delay(...).uncheckedImmediate()
///
///   The consequences of using `uncheckedImmediate()` on a publisher that does
///   not publish an element or fails right on subscription are undefined.
///
/// # Basic Immediate Publishers
///
/// `AnyImmediatePublisher` comes with factory methods that build basic
/// immediatee publishers:
///
///         // Publishes one value, and then completes.
///         AnyImmediatePublisher.just(value)
///
///         // Fails with the given error.
///         AnyImmediatePublisher.fail(error)

    ///
    /// Use `eraseToAnyImmediatePublisher()` to expose an instance of
